# react-extension

This extension connects to Twitch IRC chat and opens any Youtube links posted by the channel owner in a new tab.
Feel free to leave any suggestions/criticism since I'm pretty new to this stuff.

# Known Bugs

## Opening same link twice
If multiple links are detected, the intentional feature was to only open one of each unique link. For some reason,
it opens two before not opening duplicates.

## Video doesn't autoplay
Videos opened in new tabs need to be selected in order for the video to start playing
