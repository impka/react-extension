# react-extension

This extension connects to Twitch IRC chat and opens any Youtube links posted by the channel owner in a new tab.
Feel free to leave criticism since I'm new to this stuff.

# Known Bugs

If multiple links are detected, the intentional feature was to only open one of each unique link. For some reason,
it opens two before not opening duplicates.
